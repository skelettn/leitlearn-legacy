# Leitlearn (Legacy)

> DEPRECATED: This repository holds the legacy version of the leitlearn.com project.

## Why this legacy release?
I built a new version of Leitlearn. To keep the project accessible to everyone and preserve its history, I decided to publicly release this legacy version.

## New version
The active, maintained version is available at [Stuqy.com](https://Stuqy.com).
